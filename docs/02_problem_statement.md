# Problem Statement

Modern DevOps teams often rely on multiple CI platforms across different environments. However, inconsistent pipeline behavior between managed CI (GitHub Actions) and self-hosted CI (Jenkins) can lead to unreliable builds and deployment risks.

This project addresses the challenge of:
- Ensuring identical CI behavior across platforms
- Validating applications at runtime, not just build-time
- Handling CI failures systematically
- Maintaining cost efficiency while using cloud infrastructure
