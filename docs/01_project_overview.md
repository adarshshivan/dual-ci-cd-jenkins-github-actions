# Project Overview

This project focuses on building and validating **dual CI/CD pipelines** using two different CI systems—GitHub Actions and Jenkins—executing the same Dockerized application workflow across multiple environments.

The objective is to demonstrate how CI pipelines can be designed to be **portable, deterministic, and environment-agnostic**, while still accounting for real-world infrastructure differences.

The project emphasizes:
- CI consistency
- Pipeline-as-code
- Docker-based validation
- Failure handling and recovery
