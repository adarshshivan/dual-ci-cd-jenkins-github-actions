# DevOps Project 3 — Dual CI/CD Pipelines with Jenkins and GitHub Actions

This project demonstrates a dual CI/CD implementation using GitHub Actions and Jenkins,
with Jenkins running in two modes:
- On AWS EC2
- On a local machine

The project is designed to showcase CI portability, pipeline parity, failure simulation,
and recovery analysis using real-world DevOps practices.

Detailed documentation is available in the `docs/` directory.
